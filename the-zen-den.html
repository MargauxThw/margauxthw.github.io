        <h3>An overview</h3>
        <p>The Zen Den was an interaction design project I worked on during early 2019. The project was part of USYD’s
          second-year
          User Experience Design Studio (<a
            href="https://sydney.edu.au/courses/units-of-study/2019/deco/deco2014.html">DECO2014</a>), a core unit of
          the Bachelor of Design Computing. <br><br>

          The course of the project was mapped to the <strong>British Design Council’s Double Diamond design process
            model</strong>. This
          process has 4 key stages: <strong>Discover, Define, Develop and Deliver</strong>.

          <em>We were given the following brief to guide our design:</em>
        </p>

        <h5>
          “For a museum, theatre or festival in Sydney design a digital/tangible/spatial experience that builds upon the
          content they offer (e.g. performances, collections). It should improve the visitor experience and help the
          institution to engage with new audiences, or affirm their relationship with existing ones. The experience
          should be closely interwoven with the context; it could not exist without that environment.”
        </h5>
        <p style="padding: 2% 0">
          <strong>This was a group project</strong>. The initial research was carried out in a group of four, comprising
          of <a href="https://griffenedge.me/">Griffen Edge</a>,
          Andrew Xing, <a href="https://www.jadejiang.com">Jade Jiang</a> and myself. The latter 3 stages were
          worked on in pairs, with Jade and me working
          together.

          <h5>Research Objective</h5>
          <p>Our research objective was <strong>to gain a deep and holistic view of museum users’ experiences</strong>.
            To
            achieve this, we
            planned to gain insights into <strong>the props</strong> (the built environment and artifacts), <strong>the
              people</strong> (the user’s personal
            appeal to the space), and <strong>the processes</strong> (how the users interact with/within the
            experience).
            <br><br>
            By investigating these interconnected categories, we hoped to gain well-rounded insights into the user
            experience (summated into the following questions):
            <br>
            <ol style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">
              <li>What are the compelling factors that attract users to museums?</li>
              <li>How can we adapt museum spaces to better cater to the needs of users?</li>
              <li>How can elements of UX increase the positive impression of museums?</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h5>Sensitising</h5>
          <p>
            <strong>Our research participants were presented with sensitising materials in the lead up to our in-person
              generative
              research sessions</strong>. This was done in order to slowly allow participants to become more
            introspective
            and aware of their habits, making it easier for participants to assimilate into the generative sessions
            by“triggering
            creativity. By doing this, we were able to prompt deeper discussion and reflection on the experiences of our
            users/participants during the sessions.
            <br><br>
            <strong>The topic for our sensitising exercises was on how people spend their downtime</strong>. This broad
            topic was chosen as
            it’s open-ended (to allow for more subjective responses) while still being related to our research topic
            (museums).
            <br><br>
            <strong>The sensitising booklet consisted of 10 activities, split into 2 activities to be completed per day
              for 5 days</strong>. These 10
            activities were split into four main categories under the general terms of how people spend their downtime:
            hobbies, staying at home, going out, and socialising with friends.
            <br><br>
            <strong>We ran a pilot test with of initial sensitizing booklet</strong>, finding that we needed to adjust
            the
            order of our
            activities, make some instructions clearer, change the general aesthetic of the booklet and also add a
            conclusion. The second pilot test was well received and looked more inviting to participants, so we ran with
            that version (supplied below).
            <br>

          <h5 style="padding-top: 2%">User Research - Generative Sessions</h5>
          <p>
            <strong>We ran 2 generative sessions with 9 participants in total</strong>. These sessions were a tool
            through
            which to hear
            detailed and diverse information about the experiences of our target users, and <strong>consisted of two
              activities
              and group discussions</strong>. Within these sessions the participants could listen and bounce ideas off
            of
            each other,
            leading to <strong>useful discussion, a consensus on pain points and highlights, and deeper insights into
              the
              user
              journey</strong>.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Both the collage and cognitive map directly focused on the experience of museums</strong>. A large
            range of diverse
            stimuli (i.e. icons, pictures, words) were provided for each activity for participants to use as a guide
            through which to describe emotions and experiences. In combination, the collage and cognitive walkthrough
            were
            used to highlight the main highs and lows of the museum experience among <strong>our participants (18-25
              year
              old
              museum-goers)</strong>.

          <div class="row">
            <div class="six columns">
              <p>
                <strong>The collage</strong> used a mix of literal and ambiguous words and images to spark creativity
                and
                aid with the participants' interpretation of the activity.
                Participants were <strong>given 20 minutes to reflect and plot their experiences of museums overtime
                  before a
                  group discussion where they could share and explain further</strong>.

                write and draw about their own experiences. We <strong>asked our participants to map out their last

          <p>
            Two of my groupmates transcribed the generative sessions and picked out over 220 key quotes. From here,
            <strong>I
              grouped and organised these quotes according to key themes and ideas onto statement cards</strong>. We
            printed the
            statements cards out and physically arranged them into relevant, overarching themes of our users’
            experiences.

            The statement cards were <strong>arranged into 8 groups</strong>, with the 8 arising key themes being as
            follows:
            <br>
            <ol style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">

              <li>New experiences at museums are the most rewarding</li>
              <li>Relevant and relatable artefacts are more engaging</li>
              <li>Interactive experiences and visualisations help to create an enjoyable and immersive experience
                overall
              </li>
              <li>Perceived constraints and pressures restrict the ability to enjoy museums</li>
              <li>Social interactions enhance and add to the experience of museums</li>

            Following on from our initial research we chose to narrow in on <strong>one overarching theme</strong> for
            our solution to
            focus on, that <strong>perceived constraints and pressures restrict the ability of young adults to enjoy
              museums</strong>.
          </p>
          <h5>Design Vision</h5>
          <p>
            <strong>We aimed to foster freedom and expression of thought in young adult patrons of the White Rabbit
              Gallery</strong>.
            This was in response to members of our target audience conveying a shared feeling that perceived constraints
            and pressures restricted their ability to enjoy museums. Our target audience of Young Adults was chosen
            primarily due to the proximity of the gallery to Universities.
            <br><br>
            These perceived constraints and pressures were experienced in a number of ways and decreased their enjoyment
            and engagement with the artefacts presented. <strong>Some commonly perceived constraints included:
              carrying/managing
              belongings, imposed rules (i.e. do not touch exhibits, do not make noise), feeling as if they weren’t
              welcome, the perceived judgments being made by other patrons about them, the pace and directions of other
              people, and the perceived expectation that they would have pre-formed knowledge as well as be gaining
              cultural and historical knowledge while there</strong>.
            <br><br>
            Thus, we planned to change the museum ethos of the strict and unwelcoming environment reported by our
            patrons by making museum visitors feel more comfortable and redefining the implicit and overbearing museum
            rules.

          <h5>Storyboards & Decision Matrices</h5>
          <p>
            <strong>We each produced 2 storyboards to flesh out some ideas for solutions/approaches to the
              problem</strong>. We discussed
            and explained these ideas with a range of peers and industry professionals to help us see beyond our initial
            thinking and develop all of the ideas further.

                From there, we did a <strong>Harris Profile (Visual Decision Matrix)</strong> on each of the ideas
                proposed in order to
                standardise, centralise and justify our decision-making process regarding which idea to pursue further.
                <strong>We designed the criteria for the matrix</strong> based on a mix of what our users had identified
                as requirements,
                what the original brief required, and what secondary research suggested as key elements of successful
                experiential/spatial designs.

              <h5>The Rationale - Problem Solving Approach</h5>
              <p>
                <strong>The Zen Den was the concept chosen as it responded most effectively to our design brief,
                  according to
                  the matrices and feedback/discussion</strong>. This concept tackles the pain points of museums being
                perceived as
                too strict, being environments in which young adults feel a pressure to be intellectual, being
                unwelcoming, and being too controlled with patrons feeling very little personal ownership over their
                experience. This is done through a combination of experiential learning and immersion-oriented design
                within the context of the White Rabbit Gallery.

        <h5>Video Prototype</h5>
        <p>
          I did all of the animating for our video prototype (in Adobe After Effects), as well as the filming and
          editing (in Adobe Permiere Pro), while Jade did most of
          the graphic assets across this and the journey map. We worked together on the direction and
          information/content of both. To shoot the interactive floor scenes we used a greenscreen sheet underfoot and
          filmed with a drone.

        <p>
          Our user journey map <strong>consists of current state, future state and current-future state touchpoints</strong>. Together
          they present a comprehensive map of how we envisage that the users would interact with our concept (were it to
          be implemented).
          <br><br>
          To make this map more detailed and genuine <strong>it centres around the emotional journey, emotional states and key
          quotes (from interviews) related to four basic personas that we drew from our user research</strong>. The four personas
          are: <strong>Social Sally, Apathetic Aaron, Excited Ezra and Critical Christina</strong>. They each represent a specific
          demographic of young adults especially focused on their attitudes towards museums and recreational
          preferences. We <strong>also supplied secondary research backed explanations for the future state touchpoints where we
          had little to no direct user quotes</strong> to support our emotional mapping.

        <h5>Future State Points - User Journey Map</h5>
        <p>
          Overall, <strong>the key takeaways</strong> from our future-state touchpoints are that:
          <br>

          <ol style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">
            <li>They elevate and prolong positive emotions during the experience</li>

            <li>Users now get to leave the gallery with a souvenir, making the associated memories of the experience
              more vivid and lasting</li>
          </ol>
