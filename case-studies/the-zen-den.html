    <h2>Part 1/6</h2>
    <h3>An overview</h3>
    <p>The Zen Den was an interaction design project I worked on during early 2019. The project was part of USYD’s
      second-year
      User Experience Design Studio (<a
        href="https://sydney.edu.au/courses/units-of-study/2020/deco/deco2014.html">DECO2014</a>), a core unit of
      the Bachelor of Design Computing. <br><br>

      The course of the project was mapped to the <strong>British Design Council’s Double Diamond design process
        model</strong>. This
      process has 4 key stages: <strong>Discover, Define, Develop and Deliver</strong>.</p>

    <img class="case-img" src="../images/ZenDen/double-diamond.jpeg"
      alt="Double Diamond - Research, Design, Develop & Deliver">

    <p>
      We were given the following brief to guide our design:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      “For a museum, theatre or festival in Sydney design a digital/tangible/spatial experience that builds upon the
      content they offer (e.g. performances, collections). It should improve the visitor experience and help the
      institution to engage with new audiences, or affirm their relationship with existing ones. The experience
      should be closely interwoven with the context; it could not exist without that environment.”
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>This was a group project</strong>. The initial research was carried out in a group of four, comprising
      of <a href="https://griffenedge.com/">Griffen Edge</a>,
      Andrew Xing, <a href="https://www.jadejiang.com">Jade Jiang</a> and myself. The latter 3 stages were
      worked on in pairs, with Jade and me working
      together.

      <h4>Research Objective</h4>
      <p>Our research objective was <strong>to gain a deep and holistic view of museum users’ experiences</strong>.
        To
        achieve this, we
        planned to gain insights into <strong>the props</strong> (the built environment and artifacts), <strong>the
          people</strong> (the user’s personal
        appeal to the space), and <strong>the processes</strong> (how the users interact with/within the
        experience).
        <br><br>
        By investigating these interconnected categories, we hoped to gain well-rounded insights into the user
        experience (summated into the following questions):
        <br>
        <ol style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">
          <li>What are the compelling factors that attract users to museums?</li>
          <li>How can we adapt museum spaces to better cater to the needs of users?</li>
          <li>How can elements of UX increase the positive impression of museums?</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h4>Sensitising</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Our research participants were presented with sensitising materials in the lead up to our in-person
          generative
          research sessions</strong>. This was done in order to slowly allow participants to become more
        introspective
        and aware of their habits, making it easier for participants to assimilate into the generative sessions
        by“triggering
        creativity. By doing this, we were able to prompt deeper discussion and reflection on the experiences of our
        users/participants during the sessions.
        <br><br>
        <strong>The topic for our sensitising exercises was on how people spend their downtime</strong>. This broad
        topic was chosen as
        it’s open-ended (to allow for more subjective responses) while still being related to our research topic
        (museums).
        <br><br>
        <strong>The sensitising booklet consisted of 10 activities, split into 2 activities to be completed per day
          for 5 days</strong>. These 10
        activities were split into four main categories under the general terms of how people spend their downtime:
        hobbies, staying at home, going out, and socialising with friends.
        <br><br>
        <strong>We ran a pilot test with of initial sensitizing booklet</strong>, finding that we needed to adjust
        the
        order of our
        activities, make some instructions clearer, change the general aesthetic of the booklet and also add a
        conclusion. The second pilot test was well received and looked more inviting to participants, so we ran with
        that version (supplied below).
        <br>
      </p>

      </div>

      <h4>User Research - Generative Sessions</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>We ran 2 generative sessions with 9 participants in total</strong>. These sessions were a tool
        through
        which to hear
        detailed and diverse information about the experiences of our target users, and <strong>consisted of two
          activities
          and group discussions</strong>. Within these sessions the participants could listen and bounce ideas off
        of
        each other,
        leading to <strong>useful discussion, a consensus on pain points and highlights, and deeper insights into
          the
          user
          journey</strong>.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Both the collage and cognitive map directly focused on the experience of museums</strong>. A large
        range of diverse
        stimuli (i.e. icons, pictures, words) were provided for each activity for participants to use as a guide
        through which to describe emotions and experiences. In combination, the collage and cognitive walkthrough
        were
        used to highlight the main highs and lows of the museum experience among <strong>our participants (18-25
          year old museum-goers)</strong>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <strong>The collage</strong> used a mix of literal and ambiguous words and images to spark creativity
        and
        aid with the participants' interpretation of the activity.
        Participants were <strong>given 20 minutes to reflect and plot their experiences of museums overtime
          before a
          group discussion where they could share and explain further</strong>.
      </p>
      <!-- Collage image -->
      <img class="case-img" src="../images/ZenDen/Collage.png" alt="Statement Cards on table sorted into 8 groups">
      <p>
        <strong>The cognitive map</strong> consisted of relevant but generic icons to be used as springboards
        for
        participants to
        write and draw about their own experiences. We <strong>asked our participants to map out their last
          museum
          experience, from start to end, before another explanation/elaboration and group discussion was
          conducted</strong>.

      <h4>Synthesising Findings - Statement Cards</h4>
      <p>
        Two of my groupmates transcribed the generative sessions and picked out over 220 key quotes. From here,
        <strong>I
          grouped and organised these quotes according to key themes and ideas onto statement cards</strong>. We
        printed the
        statements cards out and physically arranged them into relevant, overarching themes of our users’
        experiences.
      </p>

      <!-- Statement Cards image -->

        alt="Statement Cards on table sorted into 8 groups">

      <p>
        The statement cards were <strong>arranged into 8 groups</strong>, with the 8 arising key themes being as
        follows:
        <br>
        <ol style="font-weight: light">
          <li>Self-direction enables self-reflection in relation to artifacts</li>
          <li>New experiences at museums are the most rewarding</li>
          <li>Relevant and relatable artefacts are more engaging</li>
          <li>Interactive experiences and visualisations help to create an enjoyable and immersive experience
            overall
          </li>
          <li>Perceived constraints and pressures restrict the ability to enjoy museums</li>
          <li>Social interactions enhance and add to the experience of museums</li>
          <li>Navigating to and through museums can be frustrating</li>
          <li>An understanding of the artifact allows for a higher level of appreciation</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </span>

    <span>
      <h4>Research Visualisation - Deliverable (Poster)</h4>
      <p>
        To finish this stage, we translated our research findings into a poster, including key quotes in support of
        the 8 key themes we observed about the museum experiences of young adults. <strong>My role was to put it all
          together;
          composing the layout, writing the summaries and selecting the quotes</strong> - shout out to <a
          href="https://www.jadejiang.com">Jade</a> for creating the
        great sculpture and people graphics!

      <h3>Develop - Ideation phase</h3>
      <button onclick="showFunction('develop')" id="developShowBtn" class="showBtn">Show process +</button>
    </div>

    <span id="more-develop" style="display: none">
      <p>
        Following on from our initial research we chose to narrow in on <strong>one overarching theme</strong> for
        our solution to
        focus on, that <strong>perceived constraints and pressures restrict the ability of young adults to enjoy
          museums</strong>.
      </p>
      <h4>Design Vision</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>We aimed to foster freedom and expression of thought in young adult patrons of the White Rabbit
          Gallery</strong>.
        This was in response to members of our target audience conveying a shared feeling that perceived constraints
        and pressures restricted their ability to enjoy museums. Our target audience of Young Adults was chosen
        primarily due to the proximity of the gallery to Universities.
        <br><br>
        These perceived constraints and pressures were experienced in a number of ways and decreased their enjoyment
        and engagement with the artefacts presented. <strong>Some commonly perceived constraints included:
          carrying/managing
          belongings, imposed rules (i.e. do not touch exhibits, do not make noise), feeling as if they weren’t
          welcome, the perceived judgments being made by other patrons about them, the pace and directions of other
          people, and the perceived expectation that they would have pre-formed knowledge as well as be gaining
          cultural and historical knowledge while there</strong>.
        <br><br>
        Thus, we planned to change the museum ethos of the strict and unwelcoming environment reported by our
        patrons by making museum visitors feel more comfortable and redefining the implicit and overbearing museum
        rules.
      </p>

        class="case-img">

      <h5>Storyboards & Decision Matrices</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>We each produced 2 storyboards to flesh out some ideas for solutions/approaches to the
          problem</strong>. We discussed
        and explained these ideas with a range of peers and industry professionals to help us see beyond our initial
        thinking and develop all of the ideas further.

      <p>
        From there, we did a <strong>Harris Profile (Visual Decision Matrix)</strong> on each of the ideas
        proposed in order to
        standardise, centralise and justify our decision-making process regarding which idea to pursue further.
        <strong>We designed the criteria for the matrix</strong> based on a mix of what our users had identified
        as requirements,
        what the original brief required, and what secondary research suggested as key elements of successful
        experiential/spatial designs.

      <h4>The Rationale - Problem Solving Approach</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>The Zen Den was the concept chosen as it responded most effectively to our design brief,
          according to
          the matrices and feedback/discussion</strong>. This concept tackles the pain points of museums being
        perceived as
        too strict, being environments in which young adults feel a pressure to be intellectual, being
        unwelcoming, and being too controlled with patrons feeling very little personal ownership over their
        experience. This is done through a combination of experiential learning and immersion-oriented design
        within the context of the White Rabbit Gallery.

    <h3>Deliver - Implementation phase</h3>
    <h4>Video Prototype</h4>
    <p>
      I did all of the animating for our video prototype (in Adobe After Effects), as well as the filming and
      editing (in Adobe Permiere Pro), while Jade did most of
      the graphic assets across this and the journey map. We worked together on the direction and
      information/content of both. To shoot the interactive floor scenes we used a greenscreen sheet underfoot
      and
      filmed with a drone.

    </div>

    <h4>User Journey Map</h4>
    <p>
      Our user journey map <strong>consists of current state, future state and current-future state
        touchpoints</strong>. Together
      they present a comprehensive map of how we envisage that the users would interact with our concept (were
      it to
      be implemented).
      <br><br>
      To make this map more detailed and genuine <strong>it centres around the emotional journey, emotional
        states
        and key
        quotes (from interviews) related to four basic personas that we drew from our user research</strong>.
      The
      four personas
      are: <strong>Social Sally, Apathetic Aaron, Excited Ezra and Critical Christina</strong>. They each
      represent
      a specific
      demographic of young adults especially focused on their attitudes towards museums and recreational
      preferences. We <strong>also supplied secondary research backed explanations for the future state
        touchpoints
        where we
        had little to no direct user quotes</strong> to support our emotional mapping.

    <h4>Future State Points - User Journey Map</h4>
    <p>
      Overall, <strong>the key takeaways</strong> from our future-state touchpoints are that:
      <br>

      <ol>
        <li>They elevate and prolong positive emotions during the experience</li>

        <li>Users now get to leave the gallery with a souvenir, making the associated memories of the experience
          more vivid and lasting</li>
